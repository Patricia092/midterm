                  <p>Why marvel is better than DC?

                    The main reason is because every DC’s characters are the copy from Marvel´s. 
                    For instance, Batman is equal to Black Widow, the only difference is that one is a male and the 
                    other is a female, but both have the same skills. Hawkeye is very similar to 
                    Green Arrow the only difference are their colors, the first one is purple and the other one is green. 
                    The same case Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman. Marvel movies have more characters. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has it all when it comes to cultivating one’s curiosity. But DC tries to dig its way out by fitting as many heroes as possible.
